# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## Overview

In this project, we focus on implementing some DOM manipulation. 

We have a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs, by default.

The user can change the grid size to be 4x4 up to 64x64.

The user may also choose any color that they wish, or even use a rainbow mode, which generates a random color per cell, or a shade mode, which will make the current cell's color 10% darker.

There is also an eraser which works just deletes the color, and there is a clear all button which resets the canvas.


I have not made this project mobile friendly, and will return to do so.
